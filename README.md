## Problem

For generations, homemade alcohol has been a staple within American culture. Today, there are more than 1.2 million homebrewers who spend over $1.3 Billion annually in the hopes of making the most delicious beers, wines and spirits possible. This industry has been exploding in recent years as well, with industry level tools becoming available to the hobby level consumer. Unfortunately, many are difficult to use and take extremely high level software knowledge to set up. Additionally, most breweries and wineries do not currently sell homebrew supplies, but we believe we can make it easy for them to enter this expanding industry by providing a brewing concentrate called Wort! Wort is a concentrate of beer that can be easily finished by simply boiling with hops and then fermenting that new mix or brew.

## Solution

We are providing an easy and fun to use tool that helps the user make their own alcohol from home. Our SAAS solution makes it possible by providing step-by-step instructions on how to make your own high quality beer and wine. This will be achieved by providing professionally made wort kits and classes from partner breweries. Tools on the application include brew tracking, dynamic unit conversion, and a community page where users can share and learn all the innovative and creative techniques of homebrewing.

## What is FerMentor?

FerMentor has taken many pivots throughout our work together but we believe we have entered into a unique market that will bring us a lot of success. On the software side, we are a mobile application that will provide various tools to make the homebrewing process simple and fun. In regards to hardware, we will have IoT capabilities with third party sensors and cooling technology so that the user has the ability to fully track and customize their homebrew. 

This github repo will contain the detail of FerMentor's mobile application.

Here is quick look of how FerMentor mobile application looks like. The app will include the recipes data, brewer discussion forum, supported tools such as conversion units, tracking, and ingredients shopping page. Users can buy the authentic worts, classes from our partner breweries, and be able to keep track of their brewing process with our sensors. Everything can be done directly in one app
